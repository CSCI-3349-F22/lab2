# Lab 2: nltk and spaCy

In this lab, you'll be learning how to use the nltk library to carry out text normalization and do some basic text analysis. At the very end, you'll use a different library, spaCy, which will allow you to do much of this normalization in a more streamlined but less transparent way. 

The lab will be entirely contained within a Jupyter notebook. If you have never used one before, don't worry! This lab will walk you through using Jupyter.

## Part 1: Installing the necessary libraries and tools

Depending on how you installed Python 3.9 and what you have done before, it's possible that you are going to need to install some stuff. 

Step 1: Make sure you can launch jupyter notebook *within Python 3.9*.

Option 1: If you have Anaconda with Pytyhon 3.9, then you most likely have jupyter already. First launch Anaconda Navigator, then click the Jupyter 

* jupyter
* nlkt
* spaCy

Step 1: Check to see if you have
Launch a python interpreter for Python 3.9. If you are going to rely on your command line for this class, just type ``python3`` (or ``python3.9``) from a Terminal
